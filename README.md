#SinaiSim
Final version is the "sinai_matrix_implementation". This is the model we build to describe the behavior of a billiard ball bouncing around a table with a circular block at its center (known as the Sinai Billiards problem). This problem–while deterministic–is mathematically chaotic, making it impractical to try to track the movement of a single ball for very long. Instead, we calculate the distribution of ball behavior for many balls bouncing around and characterize this abstracted characterizaation of balls' behavior. Our program utilizes a sparse matrix that tracks the Jacobian of the distribution, allowing us to propogate a distribution's behavior over many thousands of bounces very efficiently via matrix multiplication.
